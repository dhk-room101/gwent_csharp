# gwent_csharp
Initially this project started as a porting to C# of the AS3 repository that I reversed engineered from the original Witcher 3

Currently, the project went through a makeover favoring modern C# approach, in particular heavily using MVVM Sidekick framework by WayneBaby

In its current state, the game has basic Alpha functionality, that is the player and the AI can exchange some rounds, and there is also some score functionality.

On the to-do list there are milestones such as: 
- implement leaders and neutral cards
- expand the AI
- fully implement spy, tight bond, etc. functionality, currently some templates and basic AI strategies are ready, but there's no actual functionality to follow through
- Etc.
